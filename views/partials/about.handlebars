    Phi Sigma Rho is a social sorority for women in engineering and computer science. We are a supportive group of women who: are fun to make friends with, willing to encourage and help you in all aspects of your life, are good shoulders to lean on, and are there for you socially, academically, and emotionally. Some of the activities we participate in are socials, academic encouragement, philanthropy, and sisterhood events. We are open to all engineering majors and can't wait for you to join our sisterhood! If you're interested, please sign up on the home page!
